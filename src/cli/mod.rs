    #[command(long_about = "Sync database with JSONL file (export or import).

SAFETY GUARANTEES:
  • br sync NEVER executes git commands or auto-commits
  • br sync NEVER modifies files outside .beads/ (unless --allow-external-jsonl)
  • All writes use atomic temp-file-then-rename pattern
  • Safety guards prevent accidental data loss

MODES (one required unless --status):
  --flush-only    Export database to JSONL (safe by default)
  --import-only   Import JSONL into database (validates first)
  --status        Show sync status (read-only)

SAFETY GUARDS:
  Export guards (bypassed with --force):
    • Empty DB Guard: Refuses to export empty DB over non-empty JSONL
    • Stale DB Guard: Refuses to export if JSONL has issues missing from DB

  Import guards (cannot be bypassed):
    • Conflict markers: Rejects files with git merge conflict markers
    • Invalid JSON: Rejects malformed JSONL entries

VERBOSE LOGGING:
  -v     Show INFO-level safety guard decisions
  -vv    Show DEBUG-level file operations

EXAMPLES:
  br sync --flush-only           Export database to .beads/issues.jsonl
  br sync --flush-only -v        Export with safety logging
  br sync --import-only          Import from JSONL (validates first)
